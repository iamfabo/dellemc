## About
Guide for replacing the Data Domain System Manager self-signed SSL certificate for HTTPS access without security warnings. DDOS has a built-in tool to generate a CSR, a Windows AD CS is used to sign this CSR

## Requirements
- Data Domain appliance or Data Domain Virtual Edition
- Admin access to the Data Domain CLI
- Write access to the Data Domain file system __/ddvar__
- Windows AD CS

## Create system passphrase
`system passphrase set`

## Create new CSR
`adminaccess certificate cert-signing-request generate key-strength 2048bit country <two letter country code e.g. US> state <state> City <city> org-name <"org_name"> org-unit <org_unit> common-name <FQDN> subject-alt-name "IP:xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx, DNS:dns_short_name, DNS:FQDN"`

## Access the ddvar directory of your DDVE
This can be achieved by creating a CIFS share of the ddvar directory.

DD System Manager -> Protocols -> CIFS

## Import signed certificate
Sign the CSR by your CA

and upload it in the directory __/ddvar/certifciates__.
